      Arterial Line
    </ion-card-header>
    <ion-card-content>
      This is similar to an IV, but instead of being placed in a vein, this type of tiny plastic tube is placed in the artery. This type of line is excellent for measuring minute-to- minute changes in a child’s blood pressure. It also allows us to accurately check a child’s blood oxygen level.

      Central Venous Line
    </ion-card-header>
    <ion-card-content>
      A larger version of an “IV”, this is a longer tube that sits in larger vessels of the body. This type of IV is used for:
      <ul>
        <li>Children who have very small blood vessels that make regular IV placement difficult.</li>
        <li>Children who need medicine that is too strong for regular IV’s.</li>
        <li>Children who are likely to need IV’s for multiple days in a row.</li>
      </ul>

      IV
    </ion-card-header>
    <ion-card-content>
      A very tiny plastic tube is placed in the vein to allow medications and fluid to be injected directly into the blood stream. IV’s are usually quick to insert and have a low risk of infection. However, they usually do not last for more than a couple of days.
